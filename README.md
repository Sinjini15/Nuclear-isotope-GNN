# Learning Nuclear Cross Sections Across The Chart Of Nuclides With Graph Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project focuses on learning the chart of nuclear isotopes by enforcing a graph based structure in the latent space of popular encoding modules (VAE and INR). These latent embeddings are then leveraged for downstream nuclear cross-section ML tasks

Due to the proprietary nature of the dataset and collaboration agreements, the full codebase is private. This repository provides a high-level summary of the projectâ€™s objectives, methods, and outcomes.
